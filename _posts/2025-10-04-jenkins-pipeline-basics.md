Jenkins is one of the most powerful tools for automating software builds, tests, and deployments.  
In this post, we’ll explore how Jenkins Pipelines help create end-to-end CI/CD workflows.

## 🧩 What is a Jenkins Pipeline?

A **Pipeline** is a series of steps that defines how your application moves from code commit to deployment.  
It can include stages like:

1. **Checkout Code** – from GitHub  
2. **Build** – using Maven or Docker  
3. **Test** – automated unit/integration tests  
4. **Deploy** – to servers, Kubernetes, or AWS

## ⚙️ Sample Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running unit tests...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application to server...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
