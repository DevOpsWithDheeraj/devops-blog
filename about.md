## About Me

Hi there! 👋 I’m **Dheeraj Singh**, a **DevOps Engineer in progress** with 3+ years of experience in **system operations, automation, and continuous delivery pipelines**.  
Over the years, I’ve transitioned from traditional **Production Support** into the world of **DevOps engineering**, where I design, deploy, and automate modern infrastructure for scalable, reliable applications.

I strongly believe in the DevOps philosophy — **collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement** — and this blog is my space to document that journey.

### 🚀 My DevOps Journey

I started my career as a **Software Engineer** managing large-scale production systems where stability, uptime, and quick issue resolution were critical.  
Working closely with release and development teams exposed me to the importance of **CI/CD pipelines**, **infrastructure automation**, and **cloud-native technologies** — which sparked my shift toward DevOps.

Since then, I’ve been constantly building, experimenting, and learning how to automate end-to-end workflows — from **code commit to deployment and monitoring**.  
Through this blog, I share everything I learn — from foundational concepts to advanced project setups — so others can follow a clear and practical DevOps learning path.

### 🧠 What I Write About

This blog focuses on **real-world DevOps practices**, including:
- Building **CI/CD pipelines** with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Docker.
- Creating and provisioning infrastructure using **Terraform** and **Ansible**.  
- Deploying and scaling applications on **Kubernetes** clusters.
- Implementing monitoring and alerting with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **ELK**.  
- Hosting and automating projects on **AWS Cloud**.
- End-to-end **DevOps project implementations** with step-by-step guides.

Each article is written from a **hands-on perspective**, blending practical commands, architecture design, and troubleshooting insights gained from real project experience.

### 🌱 My Mission

My goal is to **simplify DevOps for everyone** — especially for engineers moving from production support or development backgrounds.  
I aim to break down complex topics into **clear, actionable tutorials** and **project-based learning paths**, helping others gain real-world exposure to cloud and automation workflows.

DevOps is not just about tools — it’s about creating a **culture of trust, speed, and reliability**, where teams can deliver faster without compromising quality.  
This blog is my way of contributing to that culture.

### 💡 Philosophy

> “If you can do it twice, automate it once.”

I believe every manual process in software delivery can be replaced by automation, and every automation is an opportunity to improve.  
DevOps is not a destination — it’s an evolving journey of learning, building, and sharing.

### 🌍 Beyond Tech

When I’m not building pipelines or testing deployments, you’ll find me exploring **new DevOps tools**, writing **technical tutorials**, or experimenting with **cloud projects** on weekends.  
I also love **online gaming**, **tech blogging**, and **mentoring aspiring DevOps engineers** who are just starting their journey.
